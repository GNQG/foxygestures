# Foxy Gestures

A mouse gestures extension for Firefox. This project was started as a web
extensions alternative to FireGestures. Unfortunately, FireGestures will stop
working when XUL/XPCOM add-ons are fully deprecated in Firefox 57.

#### Limitations

As a web extension, this add-on will never be as powerful as FireGestures.
This extension does not integrate into about:home, view source, etc. Nor will
it work on addons.mozilla.com, since web extensions are forbidden from
interacting with the add-on store.

#### Changelog

Version 1.0.0 released on _2017-04-07_
 - Initial release
